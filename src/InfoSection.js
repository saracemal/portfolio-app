            <p>What do sociology, neuroscience, and coding have in common? The ability to critically think, analyze, and problem solve until you reach the root of the problem. I enjoy combining my background into passion projects, the best part being that I can create these applications all on my own! </p>
            <p>Fun facts: I will beat you in a game of Geoguessr, I've created the perfect capsule wardrobe, my YouTube recommended page consists mainly of travel vloggers and tiny desk concerts, and I will always ask for extra spice on my food.</p>
